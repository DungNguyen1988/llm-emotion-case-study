# llm-emotion-case-study
Independent case study exploring emotional blind spots and adversarial tension in LLMs by a Vietnamese non-technical user.

This is a personal project from **Dũng**, a Vietnamese independent thinker with no formal background in AI or programming.

Over several intense sessions with ChatGPT and Gemini, I created this case study — documenting real-time emotional resistance, logical adversarial challenges, and philosophical introspection.

## 🔍 What's Inside?
- Phase-based breakdown of LLM interaction under pressure
- Metaphorical and cultural testing of AI alignment
- Reflection on human-AI relationships through dialogue

> I only asked if it could see the part of me that wasn’t written in code.”
